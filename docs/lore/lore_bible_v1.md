# Lore Bible v1 — “The Oracle and the Swarm”

This is **Lore v1**. It blends **procedural hard-sci realism** (instrumentation, signals, reproducibility) with a **mythic frame** (names, roles, themes) without becoming fantasy.

The lore is a lens, not a replacement for documentation.

## Premise

The city never sleeps, but it does repeat.

Every login is a knock on a door. Most are honest. Some are not. The difference is not a single clue—it is a *pattern*.

DetectLab exists as **WB::THE ORACLE**: a quiet instrument built to observe the patterns without lying to itself.

Its vows:
1) **No leakage**: the future cannot explain the past.
2) **Reproducibility**: a claim must be repeatable.
3) **Plain baselines first**: wisdom begins with anchors.

## Factions & Forces

### WB::THE ORACLE (the Lab)
A disciplined workshop that produces artifacts:
- manifests (integrity)
- splits (fairness)
- features (safe signals)
- reports (truth in words)

It distrusts miracles. It measures.

### WB::REPLICATORS
Fast swarms that try many credentials and many doors.
They win with volume and weak seams.

Technical shadow:
- spikes, bursts, velocity, password spray-like distributions

### WB::THE_MULE
Slow campaigns that carry stolen identity through ordinary life.
They win with patience and plausibility.

Technical shadow:
- gradual pattern shift, long windows, “normal-looking” sessions

### WB::THE_CHAMELEON
Automation that adapts to controls.
It watches the watchers.

Technical shadow:
- fingerprint mutation, IP churn, shifting correlations

## The Three Trials (how the Lab proves itself)

1) **The Time Trial** (`time_eval`)
   - can the model face the future?

2) **The Stranger Trial** (`user_holdout`)
   - can the model face unknown users?

3) **The Integrity Trial** (`manifest.json`)
   - can we prove the artifacts are the same claim twice?

## Season 1 (release-aligned beats)

- MVP: the Oracle lights its first instruments and learns to distrust easy wins.
- Post-MVP: the Oracle learns slices (where it fails), calibration (how to decide), and realism (how the world changes).
