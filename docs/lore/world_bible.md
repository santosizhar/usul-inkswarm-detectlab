# World Bible (Lore)

Lore exists to make DetectLab memorable and cohesive. It is **optional** and kept separate from technical docs.

## Where to start
- **Lore Bible v1:** `docs/lore/lore_bible_v1.md`
- **Glossary (lore ↔ technical mapping):** `docs/lore/glossary.md`
- **Season 1 beats (aligned with MVP and post-MVP):** `docs/lore/season_1.md`

## WB Anchors (stable references)
These anchors are used across lore documents.

- **WB::REPLICATORS** — credential-stuffing swarms that test the seams of identity and friction
- **WB::THE_MULE** — low-and-slow progression campaigns that look like “normal life” until they don’t
- **WB::THE_CHAMELEON** — adaptive automation that shape-shifts fingerprints and patterns in response to controls
- **WB::THE ORACLE** — the lab itself: a quiet instrument that sees patterns before they become stories
