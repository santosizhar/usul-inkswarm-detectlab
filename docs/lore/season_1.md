# Season 1 — Beats (MVP → Post-MVP)

Season 1 is about building instruments that do not lie.

## Episode 1 — The First Door (MVP)
- SKYNET generates the first city-night of events
- the Oracle creates splits (time + strangers)
- baseline anchors are forged (logreg + rf)
- RR proves the claim twice (determinism)

## Episode 2 — The Map of Weakness (Post-MVP)
- add slice evaluation (where it fails)
- add realism knobs (how the world shifts)
- add calibration (how to decide under constraints)

## Episode 3 — The Showcase
- a shareable UI turns runs into something stakeholders can understand quickly
- the story stays optional, but coherence increases
