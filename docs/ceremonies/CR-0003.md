# CR-0003 — Stakeholder Defensibility Review

## Why this ceremony exists
The MVP is meant to be *shareable* and *interpretable* without needing to read code. CR-0003 verifies that the story holds up for:
- **Exec stakeholders**
- **Product / Ops managers**

Low model performance is acceptable at MVP, **as long as the UI and handover explain it clearly** and the evidence is auditable.

## What we reviewed
- One-command MVP run (`detectlab run mvp`)
- Shareable static HTML viewer
- Baselines report + summary tables
- Slice + stability diagnostics
- Evidence layout / what we actually send to someone

## Decisions locked
1. **Headline truth split:** `user_holdout` is primary (generalization), `time_eval` is a drift check.
2. **Canonical share artifact:** `runs/<run_id>/share/` is the thing to zip and send.
3. **Run signatures visible:** UI shows config hash and code SHA to compare runs quickly.
4. **Narrative bar:** a non-technical reader should understand the result in ~3 minutes, and explain trade-offs in ~10 minutes.

## RR implications (for later)
- RR remains local (Windows / Python 3.12).
- RR should confirm two-run determinism and produce the `share/` folder.

## Fix-forward items produced by CR-0003
- Evidence bundle export step added to orchestrator.
- UI updated to make `user_holdout` the default focus and show run signature pills.
- UI summary now includes signature fields (config hash + code SHA).
