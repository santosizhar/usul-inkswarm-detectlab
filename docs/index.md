# Inkswarm DetectLab

Inkswarm DetectLab is a **reproducible detection lab**: it generates synthetic event telemetry, builds leakage-aware datasets, engineers safe aggregate features, and compares simple baselines.

The documentation is designed so a **non-technical reader** can still understand:
- what the project does,
- what to run,
- and how to interpret results.
