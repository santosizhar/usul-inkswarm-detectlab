# Inkswarm DetectLab — Share Package

This folder is meant to be sent as-is.

## Open this first
- `ui_bundle/index.html` (interactive, stakeholder-friendly)

## Then read
- `reports/mvp_handover.md` (plain-language interpretation)

## For deeper details (optional)
- `reports/` (pipeline outputs and diagnostics)
- `logs/` (if something failed or looks odd)
- `meta/manifest.json` and `meta/ui_summary.json` (machine-readable evidence)

If anything is missing, it usually means that step failed upstream — see `logs/`.
