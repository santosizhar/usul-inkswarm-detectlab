# Evaluation — Slices (login_attempt)

Run: `RUN_SAMPLE_SMOKE_0001`  
Generated: `None`

This report breaks performance down by **synthetic archetypes** (playbooks) and a few **obvious covariates** (MFA, country, etc.).
Metrics are computed using the **train-chosen threshold** (target FPR = 1%) and then applied to each split.

> **Status:** partial — some inputs were missing. See Notes at the bottom.

## Notes
- Missing baselines directory: runs\RUN_SAMPLE_SMOKE_0001\models\login_attempt\baselines\baselines
- No loadable baseline model artifacts found under: runs\RUN_SAMPLE_SMOKE_0001\models\login_attempt\baselines
