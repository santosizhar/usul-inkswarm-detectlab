# Inkswarm DetectLab

DetectLab is a reproducible lab to generate event-level telemetry, build leakage-aware datasets, and evaluate detection models.

**Core targets (event tables):**
- `login_attempt` (SKYNET) — includes embedded support fields.
- `checkout_attempt` (SPACING GUILD planned).

**Lore rule:** lore prose lives only in `docs/lore/world_bible.md`. Technical docs may reference lore by anchor links (e.g., WB::REPLICATORS).
