# inkswarm-detectlab — J-0008 — CF-0001 — Code Freeze

Date: 2025-12-17

## Purpose
Create a stable handoff snapshot of the repository so work can restart coherently in a future chat.

## Snapshot contents
- Includes deliverables through D-0004 and all supporting docs/journals.
- Adds Code Freeze documentation and a restart masterprompt.

## Validation status
- D-0004 is closed with **deferred validation** (see CC-0001 and DEFERRED_VALIDATION__D-0004.md).
- This CF does not claim tests are green; validation is intended to be run later locally.

## What’s next after unfreezing
1) Run deferred validation and journal results.
2) Implement D-0005 (Parquet mandatory flip).
3) CR-0002 to review robustness and packaging.
4) RR for MVP release, then CF after MVP release (if desired).

## Artifacts added in CF-0001
- CODE_FREEZE__CF-0001.md
- docs/code_freeze.md (MkDocs nav updated)
- inkswarm-detectlab__MASTERPROMPT_CF-0001__Code-Freeze-Restart.md
