# J-00XX — D-0014 — MVP_SEND Playbook + Stakeholder One-Pager

**Date:** 2025-12-19  
**Scope:** Add a repeatable “send-to-someone” playbook and a 1-page stakeholder explainer for the share bundle.

## Delivered
- `docs/mvp_send_playbook.md`
- `docs/stakeholder_one_pager.md`

## Acceptance (intended)
- A stakeholder can unzip and open `share/ui_bundle/index.html` and understand the truth-split story in <3 minutes.
- A builder can generate `MVP_SEND_<date>__share.zip` with one copy/paste block.

## Fail-closed notes
- RR determinism may remain PROVISIONAL unless Windows/Py3.12 evidence is recorded.
- Deferred validations remain deferred unless explicitly validated and journaled.

## Outcome
**D-0014 COMPLETE.**
