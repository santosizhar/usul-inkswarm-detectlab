# J-0026 — D-0024.1 — Pre-RR patch (step runner + manifest preservation)

## Intent
Prepare a safe baseline for the next RR by eliminating known pre-RR footguns:
- runtime crash in notebook reuse paths (undefined `read_json`)
- loss of recorded step history when regenerating raw tables
- packaging noise caused by `__pycache__` / `*.pyc`

## Changes
- Added `_read_json(...)` helper and replaced `read_json(...)` calls in `ui/step_runner.py`.
- Updated `pipeline.generate_raw(...)` to preserve `manifest["steps"]` if it exists.
- Cleaned generated bytecode from the deliverable snapshot; added `tools/clean_generated_files.py`.

## Expected RR impact
- Step notebook can safely reuse existing metrics artifacts without NameError.
- Forcing step 1 for an existing run does not wipe later step records.
- Deliverable zips are cleaner and diff-friendly.
